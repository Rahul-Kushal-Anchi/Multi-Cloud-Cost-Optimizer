# 🎯 **Professor Question: "Where did you get the data to train the models?"**

## 📋 **Complete Answer Guide**

### **🎯 Quick Answer (30 seconds)**
> "We use multiple data sources: **real AWS cost data** from Cost Explorer API and CUR reports, **CloudWatch metrics** for resource utilization, and **synthetic data** for ML demonstration. Our pipeline processes 365 days of historical data with 19 services across 3 regions, generating 25+ ML features for training."

- Blended and unblended costs
```

#### **B. AWS Cost and Usage Reports (CUR)**
```python
# What to show:
- Line-item billing details

### **2. Synthetic Data for ML Training**

#### **Why Synthetic Data?**
```
"For the midterm prototype, we use synthetic data to demonstrate 
ML capabilities when real data is limited. This includes:
- Simulated cost trends and patterns
- Anomaly scenarios for detection training
- Optimization scenarios for recommendation models
- Seasonal patterns and business cycles"
```

#### **Synthetic Data Generation**
```python
# Show the professor:
- 365 days of synthetic cost data
- 5 AWS services (EC2, RDS, S3, Lambda, CloudFront)
- 3 regions (us-east-1, us-west-2, eu-west-1)
- Realistic cost patterns with trends and seasonality
- Anomaly injection for detection training
